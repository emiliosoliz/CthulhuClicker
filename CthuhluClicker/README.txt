Hello everyone here is another little project I did while following along
with the Youtuber Ryisnow who I still highly recommend giving a follow
since he deserves all the praise for his work.

Anyway this is a little Cookie Clicker game that features the character
Cthulhu which the art was made by yours truly hopefully in the future
I'll have a gallery for all my art that I've made over the years.
but I do hope you enjoy the little game know buttons 3 and 4 don't do anything
because I haven't coded them to do anything yet right now. Once I have more time
on my heads I'll some more functions to the buttons.


Thank you again for checking out my work and if you have any suggestions
for other project to work on send me a message!
